## Overview

Create a webpage that allows the user to search for GIFs. Although the topic chosen is Family Guy figures, the user can actually search for anything of interest. When the user enters a search word and clicks on the Submit button, 10 GIFs will display on the screen, with the details on rating and title. There is also a Download button for each GIF. The search term will be stored at the top of the screen. If the user submits another word, another 10 GIFs will show on top of the previous 10 GIFs. The user can clear the page by clicking on the Clear button.
